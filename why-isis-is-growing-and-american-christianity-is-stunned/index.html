<p>People have an innate understanding there is something wrong with the world. Turn on the TV in any country and you are likely to see a deluge of hysteria stemming from systematic problems that are innately human. Humanity has a sin problem...which leads to an evil problem which leads to a death problem... Get the picture?</p><p>Turn it to CNN of Fox News and hysteria is the headline.</p><p>Religions offer ideas of how to address and cope what is wrong with the world. ISIS (and radical Islam in general) is growing at such a rapid pace as Western Christians are dumbfounded because ISIS is winning the war on ideas. ISIS has presented the world with a simple solution to fix the gnawing problem we all deep down know is present in the world.</p><p><i>Kill those who disagree.</i></p><p>It’s not an original idea, in fact cultures have been practicing this one for a long time. But it’s an attractive idea because ultimately it does bring a form of peace. And it’s attracting a lot of followers. People are going to great lengths across the world to enact this simple solution in efforts to bring peace in our time. We think ISIS is proposing an idea of anarchy; but it’s quite the opposite. They have laid out their version of what it takes to gain peace in this world.</p><p><b>Peace is attractive. </b></p><p>Herein lies our problem. It’s an idea problem. Those who wish to kill us have a better idea (albeit with a method of accomplishing that idea which will kill millions). American Christianity is stunned at the moment because we are losing the war of ideas.</p><p>One of my favorite movies is V for Vendetta (which is adapted from a provocative graphic novel.) The movie explores the concept that ideas are unkillable. You can kill people but once an idea takes hold, one can not destroy it. It’s a great film with an important point.</p><p><b>You can’t kill an idea. But you can come up with a better one.</b></p><p>I propose that “American” Christian has an idea problem. Look at the American flavor of a two millennia old religion. One might call what is often found in institutional Western Christianity as “Moralist Therapeutic Deism.” In broad strokes, American Christianity isn’t much Christianity any more... Rather it’s moralistic i.e. “be a good person.” We get told endlessly of the list of things to do in order to be good, upstanding citizens (and then gawk as those considered faithful fall from grace) But Jesus doesn’t call us to be good but to be holy. There is an incredible distinction between those two things. Holiness involves grace and grace is an underserved gift that meets us in our messy lives.</p><p>“American” Christianity is therapeutic because it’s self-absorbed. Pop-Christianity in America  could easily be classified as a means to make one feel better about oneself. Listen and read to the vast majority of Christian art objectively and you’ll realize it’s not calling us to authentic forms of worship and service, but to make us feel good enough about ourselves to get through today. And “American” Christianity is largely deistic, meaning that it’s point us to a generalized, politically correct, form of God instead of the Trinitarian Father, Son and Holy Spirit that has been taught, proclaimed and worshiped for the better part of 2,000 years. Deism is impersonal. The Trinitarian God gets up in your business and meets you in your messy life.</p><h2>Moralist Therapeutic Deism offers no hope for the future.<br>It offers no redemption from the past.<br>And it offers no peace for the present.</h2><p>We have an idea problem. The greatest hope, not just for the Westernized world, but the for the entire world is not humanism, it’s not radical Islam, it’s Jesus Christ.</p><p>The world needs to have the idea that “God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son...” The idea that God invites everyone to share in forgiveness, redemption and grace despite nationality, race, religion, orientation, gender, ability or past. The idea that true world peace comes only as we invite Christ’s Kingdom full of grace, mercy, justice, forgiveness and love, on earth as it is in heaven.</p><p>The idea behind Christianity leads to life and peace, not death as a means to peace. We need to throw off the shackles that have diluted Western Christianity and caste a vision of a provocative idea once again. We need a reawakening of ideas once again!</p><p>Ideas compel people to action. What actions are you willing to take to propagate the idea you are willing to live for? ISIS is enacting theirs. Will we enact ours?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="13"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="14"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="15"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="16"><span data-reactid="17"><!-- react-empty: 18 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="19"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="20">Why ISIS Is Growing and American Christianity Is Stunned</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="23"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
